<p>Welcome!</p>

<p>I am a postdoctoral research associate in the <a href="https://www.lanl.gov/org/ddste/aldsc/computer-computational-statistical-sciences/computational-physics-methods/index.php" target="_blank" rel=“noreferrer noopener”>Computational Physics and Methods</a> group at <a href="https://www.lanl.gov/" target="_blank" rel=“noreferrer noopener”>Los Alamos National Laboratory</a>. Broadly, my research interests are in development of numerical methods/models for fluid-flow simulations, turbulent flow physics, mixing, combustion, high-performance computing and scientific machine learning.</p>

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in <a href="https://www.galcit.caltech.edu/">GALCIT</a> and <a href="https://www.mce.caltech.edu/">Department of Mechanical and Civil Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/">Caltech</a> and a doctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.ae.illinois.edu/">Department of Aerospace Engineering </a> at <a href="https://www.illinois.edu/">UIUC</a>.
