At Penn, I was involved in the following course:

* [CIS 540: Principles of Embedded Computation](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis540/) (Spring 2019)

  I helped by giving an occasional lecture and creating a project for the students: [Leader Election in P#](https://github.com/fniksic/PSharp/blob/CIS540/CIS540Project/LeaderElection.md).

At the MPI-SWS, I was a teaching assistant for two courses:

* [Program Analysis](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rayna/pa1617.html)
  (Winter 2016/2017)
* [Verification of Reactive Systems](https://wiki.mpi-sws.org/wiki/Courses/VRS) (Summer 2014)

  Here are my [lecture notes on propositional logic](/assets/files/propositional-logic.pdf), and my [solution](https://github.com/fniksic/labyrinth)
  to [Problem L (Labyrinth)](https://ipsc.ksp.sk/2013/real/problems/l.html) from [IPSC 2013](https://ipsc.ksp.sk/2013/problems) that reduces the problem to [SAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem).

At the Department of Mathematics, University of Zagreb, I was a student assistant
for the following courses:

* Application of Parallel Computers (Summer 2009)
* Introduction to Parallel Computing (Winter 2008)
* Set Theory (Summer 2008)
