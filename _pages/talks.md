Here are two of my talks that were recorded and are available online.

## Why Is Random Testing Effective for Partition Tolerance Bugs?

The first talk, given at [POPL 2018](https://popl18.sigplan.org/)
in Los Angeles, is a presentation of my paper with
[Rupak Majumdar](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rupak/) on
testing distributed systems under network partitions.

## Nasumiƒçno testiranje distribuiranih sustava

The next talk was given in April 2018 at the [Mathematical
Logic and Foundations of Mathematics Seminar](https://sites.google.com/site/tinperkov/slom) in Zagreb, and it is about applying combinatorial
techniques in testing distributed systems. The talk is in Croatian.

(For some reason I'm wearing the same T-shirt in both talks. :open_mouth:)
